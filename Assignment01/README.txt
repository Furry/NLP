# About the code
Since during testing, recomputing the dictionary of words was pretty tedious, it uses a set 'trainingData.json' file that contains the count of every single word/bigram/trigram/fourgram.
This can be deleted before running, and will simply be recreated. All it does is save time. 

# Running
The source file is within the ./code/ directory.
To run, it's the following command:

mac: `python3 ./code/main.py`
windows: `python ./code/main.py`

# Included Files:
- ./code/main.py
- ./code/trainingData.json
- ./README.md
- Assignment01ProblemDescription.pdf
- ./DUC 2005 Dataset/
